# Ramen-Rater-app
## Description of the app.
This is my attempt at the Ramen Rater app.
The app displays a variety of ramen from different restaurants and how they are rated.
The app has a form at the bottom of the page that allows users to input their ratings to add to the list.
The form takes:
- The name of the ramen.
- The name of the restaurant.
- An image link to display to other users.
- Your rating of the dish.
- Comments on your opinion of the dish. 

Once a user submits the form and their inputs, the page updates the list of images of Ramen. Their image gets added to the list.

When the webpage loads, The user is only able to view the images of ramen. To view more information about the specific ramen image; the user can click on an image and information about the ramen displays underneath the image. To return to the previous view; just click on the same image once again and the text clears.
